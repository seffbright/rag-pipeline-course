        "**Unstructured data:** Content without a predefined data model or organization, such as emails, documents, and social media posts. Unlike structured data (databases, spreadsheets), unstructured data requires special processing to extract meaningful information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Metadata:** Information about your data, such as source, creation date, author, and document title. This helps with filtering, ranking, and tracking where information came from.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parser:** A software component (often a code library) that reads unstructured content, like documents or emails, and breaks it into meaningful parts, such as sections, titles, or keywords. This helps systems organize and understand the data more easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "**OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Technology that converts images of text (like scanned documents or photos) into machine-readable text that can be processed and searched.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Schema:** The structure or format of data - like knowing that a CSV has columns for \"date\", \"customer\", and \"issue\" in that order.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Understanding Text Chunking\n",
        "\n",
        "Chunking is a key step in making documents usable for RAG systems. Because language models have a limited <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**context window**</font>, we can't give them huge documents all at once. Instead, we split the text into smaller, <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**indexable**</font> parts like we would a long book into chapters or sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are different ways to split documents. You can divide them based on <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**tokens**</font>, words, or characters, or use natural <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**semantic boundaries**</font> like sentences, paragraphs, or sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "The way you split, known as a <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**chunking strategy**</font>, affects how well the system understands and retrieves the content. If your chunks are too small, you might lose important context. If they're too big, you might add noise or go over the model's input limit. To preserve <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**semantic coherence**</font>, it's important to avoid splitting in the middle of meaningful units like a list, example, or explanation. Many pipelines also use <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**overlap**</font> between chunks to maintain continuity across boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "A good chunking strategy balances size, structure, and meaning to ensure that chunks are both complete in thought and efficient for retrieval and generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Chunking Trade-Offs\n",
        "\n",
        "**Granularity vs Context:**\n",
        "- **Fine chunks** (100-200 tokens): Precise matching but may miss broader context\n",
        "- **Medium chunks** (300-500 tokens): Balanced approach for most use cases  \n",
        "- **Large chunks** (800-1200 tokens): Rich context but may introduce noise\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example: Answering \"How do I reset my password?\"**\n",
        "- **Too small:** Chunk has \"click Reset\" but not the full process\n",

        "**Context window:** The maximum amount of text (input prompt + generated output) an LLM can process at one time, typically measured in tokens (roughly words/syllables).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Indexable:** Easy to store, search, and retrieve. These are chunks of content that are small enough to fit in search systems and big enough to still make sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tokens:** Tiny pieces of text that the AI reads. This is sometimes full words, sometimes just parts. For example, \"chunking\" might be one token, but \"internationalization\" might be split into many.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Semantic boundaries:** Natural breaks in language flow like sentence endings, paragraph breaks, or section headers where splitting won't disrupt meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Chunking strategy:** The systematic approach to splitting documents - the rules and methods that determine where and how to break up text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Semantic coherence:** How well a chunk maintains complete meaning. High coherence means the chunk contains complete thoughts rather than cutting them off midway.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Overlap:** Repeating some content between adjacent chunks to preserve context and ensure important information isn't lost at boundaries.\n",

        "\n",

        "- **Token-Based Chunking**: Evenly-sized segments for generic content  \n",
        "- **Sentence Chunking**: Maintains meaning and context for troubleshooting or conversational text  \n",
        "- **Paragraph Chunking**: Preserves formatting for structured content like policies  \n",
        "- **Adaptive Chunking**: Dynamically chooses the best strategy based on file type and content  \n",

        "### Key Components:\n",
        "- **tiktoken**: Tokenizer to measure chunk sizes  \n",

        "- **Strategy Dictionary**: Custom rules per document  \n",

        "- Smart chunking maximizes retrievability and reduces hallucinations  \n"

        "\n",
        "To help AI find information based on meaning (not just matching words), we convert text into <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**number patterns (embeddings)**</font>. These patterns represent the ideas in the text, so similar concepts have similar patterns — this is known as <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**semantic similarity**</font>. It's like turning words into a language the AI can truly understand inside a <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**vector space**</font>.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these embeddings lives in a space with many directions. The number of directions is called its <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**dimensionality**</font>. More dimensions can mean more expressive power, but also more complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The type of <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**embedding model**</font> you use really matters. If the model isn't trained for your topic or language, it won't capture the right meaning, even if everything else in your system works well.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's like trying to read a translated book where the translation is wrong. You just won't understand it. That's why it's important to test your embeddings with real examples from your domain to ensure proper <font color='blue' size=\"3em\">**domain adaptation**</font> for your specific use case.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Cosine Similarity Function**:\n",

        "**Query transformation:** Changing the question to make it easier for the system to find the right answer — like rewording it, adding keywords, or splitting it into smaller parts.\n",

        "## 🛠️ Query Transformation Techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Query Expansion**\n",
        "Adding related terms to capture more relevant documents:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "Original: \"login error\"\n",
        "Expanded: \"login error authentication failure sign-in problem access denied\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Synonym Substitution**\n",
        "Replacing terms with domain-specific alternatives:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "Original: \"API timeout\"\n",
        "Transformed: \"API timeout service unavailable request timeout connection timeout\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Query Decomposition**\n",
        "Breaking complex queries into simpler parts:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "Original: \"How to reset password and update email address?\"\n",
        "Decomposed:\n",
        "- \"how to reset password\"\n",
        "- \"how to update email address\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Context Enhancement**\n",
        "Adding implicit context based on user history or domain:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "Original: \"deployment error\"\n",
        "Enhanced: \"deployment error kubernetes docker container application\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚀 Knowledge Check Questions\n",

        "1. **Context enhancement** - Add domain-specific terms based on the user's role or previous queries\n",
        "2. **Query clarification** - Ask follow-up questions to narrow down the request\n",
        "3. **Broad-to-narrow search** - Start with broad results, then help users refine\n",

        "1. **Exact matches are critical** - Legal terms, product codes, technical specifications\n",
        "2. **User intent is very specific** - When users use precise terminology intentionally\n",
