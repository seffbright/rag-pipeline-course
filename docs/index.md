# RAG Pipeline Workshop

Welcome to the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline Workshop**.

This course is an interactive journey designed to take you from **zero knowledge** to building **production-grade RAG systems** using modern AI tooling.

You will learn:
- How RAG systems work under the hood
- How documents become searchable knowledge
- How embeddings, vector databases, and LLMs fit together
- How to evaluate and improve real-world RAG pipelines

## 🎯 Course Mission

To demystify Retrieval-Augmented Generation by **building every component step by step**, combining conceptual understanding with hands-on implementation.

## 🧭 How This Course Works

Each module follows the same pattern:

1. **Conceptual Explanation** (you’re here now)
2. **Design Decisions & Trade-offs**
3. **Hands-on Notebook Lab**
4. **Evaluation & Improvement**

👉 Code lives in Jupyter notebooks  
👉 Concepts live in these docs  

This keeps learning clear, focused, and practical.
