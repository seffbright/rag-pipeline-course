# Vector Databases

A vector database stores embeddings and allows **fast similarity search**.

Instead of searching text directly, you search vectors using distance metrics like cosine similarity.

## Why Not Traditional Databases?

Relational databases are great for:
- Exact matches
- Structured queries

They are terrible at:
- Semantic similarity
- High-dimensional vector search

Vector databases are built specifically for this problem.

## In This Course

We’ll use **Pinecone** to:
- Store embeddings
- Perform fast similarity search
- Power retrieval in our RAG pipeline
